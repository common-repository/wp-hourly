== DESCRIPTION ==

WP HOURLY is the most simple yet advanced solution for managing your billable time using your WordPress website. It is ideal for Freelancers and Agencies alike, giving you the ability to create tasks and assign them to your team members (Employees). An Employee can then submit time records. These time records are grouped per customer, projects and tasks. The plugin also features extensive reports as well, which you can use for billing your customers or paying your employees.

While this plugin is best suited for Agencies and Freelancers who need to charge for their hourly work directly on their website, and not on any big freelancing platform, it works just as fine for other businesses that need to provide time reports to their Customers.

Basically, any business that needs to keep a record of their worked time can use WP Hourly!

**THE CONCEPT**

We are developing using WordPress ourselves and we do a lot of hourly work. We also work on freelancing platforms but we never liked the restrictiveness they come with or how uneasy it was to merge them into our country-specific bookkeeping and accounting. So we went ahead to create our own solution. We developed WP HUORLY and we have since tracked over 27.000 billable hours with it in 3+ years!!!

**KEY PLUGIN FEATURES**
* Set a global Hourly Rate or specify a different hourly rate per Customer, Project or Task
* Assign Projects, Tasks and Time Records to a Customer(works with the WooCommerce "customer" role)
* Assign Time Records to your Employees and thus see how much time your team spends on what Tasks
* Find Projects and Tasks easy with the built-in search and filter options
* Compatible with the [Order Signature for WooCommerce](https://superwpheroes.io/product/order-signature-for-woocommerce-pro/ "Convert the WooCommerce order into a Signed Confirmation of Service document") plugin - turn your orders into Signed Confirmation of Service documents
* Detailed Time Reports both for Administrators and Customers which can be used to bill your customers or pay your employees

= What 3rd party plugins do I need in order to use WP HOURLY? =

There are no other plugins required for it to work, but if you wish to collect payments with WooCommerce, you do need to WP Hourly WooCommerce Integration add-on and WooCommerce installed and activated. It also works super nice with the Order Signature for WooCommerce plugin, if you wish to give your payments a "contract" or confirmation of service legal aspect.

= What user roles does this plugin add or use? =

WP HOURLY adds an Employee role (which is basically and assignee for a Task or Time Record). This is done to help facilitate teams, or agencies. Single freelancers may not need this feature. If WooCommerce is not installed, then it will also create the Customer user role... time has to be billed to a customer, after all.

WP HOURLY heavily relies on the Customer role inserted by WooCommerce. This is basically your client, the entity who needs to pay for the generated billable time :)

= How do I use Invoices or accounting software integration with WP HOURLY? =

You can use any invoice generating plugin or service in order to send to your clients for payment. What WP Hourly does is that it generates a report which you can send along with that invoice. That report is broken down into Projects and Tasks so that you can show your client exactly what you have been working on. If you want to go one step ahead, you can have your customers pay you directly on your website, by also using the WP Hourly WooCommerce Integration and WooCommerce. You can then collect payments for your time using any activated checkout method you would usually use with WooCommerce... and use any WooCommerce Invoice generating plugins too, that would generate an invoice based on the order (payment in this case).

= GDPR =

This plugin does not use any kind of personal data except for what is already stored and used by your WordPress and WooCommerce website. So as long as you have GDPR covered for that, which you should, you should be good to go.
